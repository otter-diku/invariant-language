Schemas:

ORDER_SUBMITTED(order_id, order_date, order_amount)
PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL(order_id, payment_amount)
PAYMENT_FAILED(order_id)
POLICY_CREATE(policy_id, premium, limit)
POLICY_UPDATE(policy_id, premium, limit)
POLICY_DELETE(policy_id)


-- time window invariants (time based)
EVENTS (ORDER_SUBMITTED os, PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL ps, PAYMENT_FAILED pf)
WHERE os.order_id = ps.order_ID OR os.order_id = pf.order_id
WITHIN 5 seconds

==> simple flink cep query order_submitted followed by payment_successful or payment_failed within 5 seconds



-- ordering invariants (value based)
EVENTS (ORDER_SUBMITTED os, PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL ps)
WHERE os.order_id = ps.order_ID
ORDERING < os, ps >
WINDOW 5 minutes



-- interleavings
EVENTS (POLICY_UPDATE pu, POLICY_CREATE pc, POLICY_DELETE pd)
WHERE pu.policy_id = pc.policy_id AND pc.policy_id = pd.policy_id
ORDERING < pu, pd, pc > OR < pc, pu, pd >
WINDOW 5 minutes
